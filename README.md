# Attunement
Replacement for Harmony - Extensive connectivity options and compatibility with existing harmony remote

## Project Aims:
- Node red based control, Auto generated through wizard with ability to modify limitlessly
- Tight integration with home assistant
- Extensive connectivity and controllability (MQTT, HTTP, terminal, IR, RS232 etc)
- Bluetooth passthrough for 1 keyboard/mouse shared between multiple devices
- Expansible hardware built on raspberry pi (lots of IR outputs/inputs, Ethernet)
- Customise everything on the remote
- hosted completely locally
- Extraction of all IR commands from harmony
- Reuse of existing Harmony Remote (Remote uses unique IR commands to trigger Attunment Functions)
